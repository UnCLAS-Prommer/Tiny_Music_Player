[00:11.59]The place changes and goes, like a wind, like clouds
[00:22.31]Like the traces of the heart, no halt at the places.
[00:37.04]The place is so far away, be far apart
[00:47.50]People's hand does not reach, so merely has (the) worship.
[01:01.75]The place is a lofty lord, can't meet nobody put on
[01:12.96]We will lose the place, so lofty which changes.
[01:26.03]Not all were desired, however we're never sad
[01:38.24]Still, there is still the place far away, far away.
[01:53.03](The wind) blows through the place, an endless with all
[02:03.73]Like the ripple float on the water, it blows at as it goes.
[02:18.79]The place is no make at all, nothing is shown
[02:29.32]Like the sand clasped by hand, it falls vainly.
[02:43.37]The place is (a) profound lord, and wear the vain faint light
[02:54.48]But we will find it in the place, the hut at which it stands still.
[03:08.54]If not cencerned with all, it will maintain that no dye
[03:20.05]Therefore there is still the hut, it's lonly, solitary.
[03:34.64]No halt at the wind, it soars to the sky
[03:45.60]Like the verdure (which) meets with sunrise, it grows up as reborn.
[04:00.18]The hut has held new one that's different from all
[04:10.98]Like the sand castle of the children, but realized with the mind.
[04:25.12]The person is a vain statue wear taciturnity calm
[04:36.43]Still, we will know a huge flow, it is stopped by nobody.
[04:47.25]Soon, the wind wears the snow cloud, will be dyed to snow-white
[04:58.90]Summer grass will incline, no sunlight, feebly shade.
[05:09.50]
[05:25.00]
[05:42.05]The place buried in deep snow, like the collapsing castle
[05:52.47]Like the head of the shade, figure will be thrown away.
[06:07.43]The hut buried in deep snow, it sinks in to the flood
[06:17.99]and the "not dyeing" is dyed out, and waits for a oppose one.
[06:31.92]Even if all are healed, be gonna no return
[06:43.46]There is still the place, far way, far away.
[06:58.39]The place changes and goes, Like a wind, like clouds
[07:08.86]Like the traces of the heart, no halt at the places.
[07:23.82]The place is a lofty lord, can't meet nobody put on
[07:34.27]Still, there is still the place, far away, far away.
